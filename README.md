#### Quality Notice

Generally speaking, this is not professional work.  This is a personal set of
repositories where I am chasing whatever whimsy appeals.

As exclusions to the above, the following repositories are known to be in
production:

- [devproxy2](https://github.com/sapphirecat/devproxy2)
- [dynacache](https://github.com/sapphirecat/dynacache), though source is
  unavailable for political reasons

There is no support guarantee, but they are _more_ likely to be proactively
updated if they break.
